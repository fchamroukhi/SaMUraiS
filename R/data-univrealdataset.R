#' Time series representing the electrical power consumption during a switch
#' operation
#'
#' This dataset provided for illustration only, is issued from the switch
#' railway monitoring domain. The switch "mechanism" enables trains to be guided
#' from one track to another at a railway junction. During each switch
#' operation, a set of measurements are recorded. Each measurement represents
#' the consumed electrical power.
