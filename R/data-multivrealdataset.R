#' Time series representing the three acceleration components recorded over time
#' during the activity of a given person.
#'
#' This dataset provided for illustration only, represents the three
#' acceleration components recorded over time during the activity of a given
#' person. These data consist therefore in multidimensional time series with
#' several regime changes over time, each regime is associated with an activity.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 2253 rows and 4 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{x}{The covariate variable which is the time in that case.}
#'   \item{y1}{X axis component of the acceleration.}
#'   \item{y2}{Y axis component of the acceleration.}
#'   \item{y3}{Z axis component of the acceleration.}
