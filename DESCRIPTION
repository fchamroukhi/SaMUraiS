Description: SaMUraiS is a toolbox including many flexible user-friendly and 
    original statistical latent variable models and unsupervised algorithms to 
    segment and represent, time-series data (univariate or multivariate), and 
    more generally, logitidunal data which include regime changes. Our 
    SaMUraiS use mainly the following efficient 'sword' packages to segment 
    data: RHLP, MRHLP, HMMR, MHMMR, PWR.
