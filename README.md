# SaMUraiS
StAtistical Models for the UnsupeRvised segmentAion of tIme Series

SaMUraiS is a toolbox including many flexible user-friendly and efficient statistical latent variable models and unsupervised algorithms to segment and represent, time-series data (univariate or multivariate), and more generally, logitidunal data which include regime changes.
This includes namely the following packages

RHLP 

MRHLP 

HMM/HMMR 

MHMMR 

PWR

The models and algorithms are developped and written in Matlab by Faicel Chamroukhi, and translated and designed into R packages by Florian Lecocq, Marius Bartcus and Faicel Chamroukhi.
