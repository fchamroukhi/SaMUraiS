\format{A data frame with 670 rows and 2 variables:
\describe{
\item{x}{The covariate variable which is the time in that case.}
\item{y}{The time series. The latter has been generated as follows:

with mean 7.
\item Third regime: 200 values of Normally distributed random numbers
with mean 4.
\item Fourth regime: 100 values of Normally distributed random numbers
with mean -2.
\item Fifth regime: 150 values of Normally distributed random numbers
with mean 3.5.
